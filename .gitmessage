# Follow the Conventional Commits specification, conventionalcommits.org
# See commitlintrc.yaml for specifics.
#
# Other guidelines to observe include:
#
# 1. Prefer the present tense, imperative mood, e.g. "Change the default
#    value to 10" rather than "This changes the default value to 10" or
#    "Changed the default value to 10" or "Changes the default value to
#    10".
# 2. Limit the title/summary to 50 characters. Use sentence-case. Do not
#    end with a period.
# 3. Wrap all other lines at 72 characters.
# 4. Use asterisks or hyphens to create lists.
# 5. Indent code blocks by 4 spaces. Wrap inline code examples with
#    backticks.
# 6. Clearly highlight important information like breaking changes, the
#    need to alter the database, the risk of destroying data, etc. in a
#    list section marked "**IMPORTANT**". Make use of lists.
# 7. Reference all related issues/tickets/PRs in the footer. Use
#    keywords like "Fixes", "Resolves", "Closes", and "Related".
