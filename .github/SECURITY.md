# Reporting Security Issues

We take security issues seriously.

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, go to the project's issues page and create a new issue. Read and follow the instructions of the issue template carefully.

If publicly reporting your findings could result in the leakage of data or put the project or application at greater risk, please email [info@lionelslegacyjersey.com](mailto:info@lionelslegacyjersey.com) directly and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We'll endeavour to respond to you as quickly as possible.
